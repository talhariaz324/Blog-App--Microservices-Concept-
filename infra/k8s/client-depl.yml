      #  Change the paths from localhost to posts.com so that when req the browser -> loadbalancer -> ingress controller -> path (of pod) -> execute the status
      # We dont push the client as there was some issue with the image building of it. But that's how the things work.
      # if we still go browser and do posts.com/posts gives the empty object means its working. As we dont deploy client so its not a big deal
